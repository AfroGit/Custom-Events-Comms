## Goals.

#### Lightning web components that communicate with one another.
#### Communicate from a child component to its parent component.
#### Communicate from a parent component to a child component.
####Communicate from a component to an unrelated component
<br>
###  When multiple Lightning web components compose an app, we often want those components to share information. 
How we communicate from one component to another depends on whether and how the components are related. 
A component inside another component creates a parent-child relationship. 
How a parent communicates with a child is different from how a child communicates with its parent.
You can use Lightning message service to communicate with Aura components and Visualforce pages as well. 
Itâ€™s the cleanest way to keep different types of components in sync.
